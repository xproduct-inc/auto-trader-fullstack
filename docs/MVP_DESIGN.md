# MVP Design: Local Trading Assistant

## Overview
A locally running system of agents that continuously analyze market data, generate strategies, and suggest executable trades based on configurable technical indicators.

## Core Components

### 1. Market Observer Agent
- **Purpose**: Continuous market data monitoring
- **Functions**:
  - Stream real-time data from exchanges
  - Calculate configured technical indicators
  - Detect pattern formations
  - Monitor options-specific metrics (IV, Greeks, etc.)
- **Configuration**:
  ```yaml
  market_observer:
    update_interval: 5s  # How often to refresh data
    exchanges: ["binance"]
    pairs: ["BTC-USDT"]
    indicators:
      iv_rank: true
      gamma_exposure: true
      orderblocks: true
      wyckoff: true
      # Other indicators disabled for MVP
  ```

### 2. Strategy Agent
- **Purpose**: Generate trading strategies based on market conditions
- **Functions**:
  - Analyze market observer outputs
  - Identify trading opportunities
  - Generate specific entry/exit conditions
- **Configuration**:
  ```yaml
  strategy:
    min_confidence: 0.8
    strategy_types:
      - "volatility_arbitrage"
      - "gamma_scalping"
      # Limited strategies for MVP
    update_interval: 15s
  ```

### 3. Risk Manager Agent
- **Purpose**: Validate strategies against risk parameters
- **Functions**:
  - Position sizing
  - Risk/reward validation
  - Portfolio exposure checks
- **Configuration**:
  ```yaml
  risk:
    max_position_size: 0.01  # 1% of portfolio
    max_risk_per_trade: 0.005  # 0.5% risk per trade
    min_rr_ratio: 2.0  # Minimum risk/reward ratio
  ```

### 4. Trade Suggester Agent
- **Purpose**: Convert validated strategies into actionable trades
- **Functions**:
  - Format trade suggestions
  - Provide entry, exit, and stop levels
  - Include trade rationale
- **Output Format**:
  ```json
  {
    "trade_id": "uuid",
    "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
    "type": "ENTRY",
    "instrument": "BTC-USDT-CALL-50000-20240331",
    "direction": "BUY",
    "entry": {
      "price": 2500,
      "rationale": "IV rank low, strong support at current levels"
    },
    "exit": {
      "take_profit": 3000,
      "stop_loss": 2300,
      "rationale": "Based on key resistance levels"
    },
    "risk_metrics": {
      "position_size": "0.1 BTC",
      "risk_amount": "$200",
      "risk_reward": "2.5"
    },
    "indicators_triggered": [
      "iv_rank_below_20",
      "wyckoff_accumulation",
      "orderblock_support"
    ]
  }
  ```

## System Flow

1. **Continuous Monitoring**:
   ```
   Market Data Stream → Market Observer → Event Bus
   ```

2. **Strategy Generation**:
   ```
   Event Bus → Strategy Agent → Risk Manager → Trade Suggester
   ```

3. **User Interface**:
   ```
   Trade Suggester → Local API → User Notification
   ```

## Local Storage
- Redis for real-time data and caching
- SQLite for trade history and performance tracking
- Configuration files for settings

## User Interaction
1. **Configuration**:
   - Edit YAML files for indicator selection
   - Set risk parameters
   - Choose trading pairs

2. **Operation**:
   - Start system with `make run-local`
   - View suggestions via API or CLI
   - Get notifications for new trade ideas

3. **Trade Execution**:
   - Review trade suggestions
   - Manual execution on exchange
   - Track performance

## MVP Limitations
1. Limited to specific indicators defined in config
2. Focus on options-specific patterns
3. Manual trade execution only
4. Single exchange support initially
5. Basic backtesting capabilities

## Monitoring & Logging
1. Health checks for each agent
2. Performance metrics for indicators
3. Strategy success rate tracking
4. Risk compliance logging

## Future Expansion
1. Additional indicators
2. Multiple exchange support
3. Automated execution
4. Advanced backtesting
5. Web interface
